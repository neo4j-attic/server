Starting the Neo4j server in high availability mode
===================================================

To run the Neo4j server in high availability mode there are two things you need to do.
You have to configure the server to start up the database in high availability mode and you have to configure the Neo4j database for operating in high availability mode.

Instructing the server to start the database in high availability mode is as easy as setting the +org.neo4j.server.database.mode+ property in the server properties file (+neo-server.properties+) to +ha+.
The default value for this parameter is +standalone+, which will start the database in standalone mode.

Configuring the Neo4j database for operating in high availability mode requires sepcifying a few properties in +neo4j.properties+.
First you need to specify +ha.machine_id+, this is a possitive integer id that uniquely identifies this server in the cluster.

Example: +ha.machine_id = 1+

Then you have to specify +ha.zoo_keeper_servers+, this is a comma separated list of hosts and ports for communicating with each member of the Neo4j Coordinator cluster.

For example: +ha.zoo_keeper_servers = neo4j-manager-01:2180,neo4j-manager-02:2180,neo4j-manager-03:2180+.

You can also, optionally, configure the +ha.cluster_name+.
This is the name of the cluster this instance is supposed to join.
Accepted characters are alphabetical, numerical, dot, dash, and underscore.
This configuration is useful if you have multiple Neo4j HA clusters managed by the same Coordinator cluster.

Example: +ha.cluster_name = my_neo4j_ha_cluster+

Starting a Neo4j Coordinator
----------------------------

A Neo4j Coordinator cluster provides the Neo4j HA Data cluster with reliable coordination 
of lifecycle activities, like electing the master.
Neo4j Server includes everything needed for running a Neo4j Coordinator. 

Configuration of a Coordinator is specified in these files:

* +conf/coord.cfg+ - coordinator operational settings
* +data/coordinator/myid+ - unqiue identification of the coordinator

Once a Neo4j Coordinator instance has been configured, you can use the +bin/neo4j-coordinator+ command to run the server.
