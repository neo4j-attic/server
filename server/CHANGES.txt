1.3.M03 (2011-02-24)

o Changed the configuration file format to make it simpler and less error prone (but it is *not*) backwards compatible with earlier versions
o Separated out the server plugin API for easier development, making only the only development dependency for server a very thin layer and small jar


1.3.M02 (2011-02-10)
--------------------
o Gremlin updated to 0.7 and trimmed down to bare bones dependencies
o Webadmin minor improvements in Console, Data browser and monitoring

------------------------

o Added support for server plugins that extend the functionality of the graph database, a node, or a relationship.
o Bridge OSGi LogService to server Logger. Bundle log messages and stdout pipe through correctly.
o Refactoring of functional tests to remove static dependencies. Introduced a server builder to deal with it instead.
o Can now add performance-tweaking properties to the database hosted by the server. It uses the same neo4j.properties file as the embedded version, but you need to add a property: 
  org.neo4j.server.db.tuning.properties into the neo4j-server.properties file.
o Webadmin: Removed component titles, added save button to data browser, minor change to data browser layout.
o Webadmin: Minor UI updates, added error message that shows up when server connection is lost.

o Webadmin: Made 30minutes the default view in charts.

o Webadmin: Disallow self relationships in UI, and show error message explaining this.
o Can now load 3rd party JAX-RS jars from the classpath.
o Updated static assembly to properly include both webadmin statics and documentation. Documentation now tested and ships properly down to neo4j-standalone.
o Webadmin: Made the current node show up by default when adding new relations in webadmin.
o Webadmin: Dashboard shows charts with tabs, and allows switching between charts.
o Added a basic readme with instructions for building, running, and functional testing.
o Updating the way to create temporary files to solve the functional test problem where lots of files stick around.
o re-implemented REST to expose indexing of nodes and relationships (new index API)
o single path algo works in RestfulGraphDatabase now

o Http DELETE requires the proper mediatype to accept
o All indexes must be created to use them.
